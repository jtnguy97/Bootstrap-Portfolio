        <h3 class = "article"> What exactly are virtual youtubers? </h3>
        <p class = "paragraph">  Virtual Youtubers (also known as vtubers) can range from corporate or indie streamers. Whether they are corporate or indie streamers, there is a cult fandom that comes along with being a streamer. Being a virtual youtuber nonetheless, you take on a different persona along with the lore of the character you pretend to be.</p>

        <h3 class = "article"> Vtuber fandoms and the financial implications behind it </h3>
        <p class = "paragraph"> There isn’t really a limited amount of words I can use to describe how dedicated vtuber fans are when it comes to the financial aspect. There are projects to have billboards setup in many parts of the world such as Chinese billboards or even Times Square billboards. It becomes even more obsessive in Asian fandoms in vtuber culture, because there is the aspect of bulk buying merch. In the corporate vtuber industry, there is merch that comes out regularly to celebrate any holiday: birthdays, 6 month anniversaries, Christmas, summer, Valentines, etc. Streaming numbers are usually compared to see which vtubers are at the top of the rankings. Not only does this become toxic, but fandoms are unusually obsessive in how they analyze data between each corporate vtuber. Not only are streaming numbers a big comparison, but also how much merchandise is sold. </p>

        <br>

        <h3 class = "article"> Vtuber fandoms’ toxicity and crossing boundaries  </h3>
        <p class = "paragraph">As obvious as this sounds for fandoms, there are many vtuber fans who try to control these streamers. Because vtuber fans are constantly throwing “superchats” (Youtube donations) to these streamers, that part of the fandom reinforces the idea that they are paying for the vtuber’s services. Fans who spend a lot of money on vtubers think that because they send money, the vtubers have to listen to their orders. </p>

        <br>

        <h3 class = "article">  Victimization of Vtubers </h3>
        <p class = "paragraph">  While fandom toxicity towards the vtuber in which they want to “control the vtuber” exists, there is something that completely opposes this idea. This is the idea of victimization and babying. Instead of controlling the vtuber, a bad situation that occurs is when the fandom coddles the vtuber as if they can’t speak for themselves. There are some vtubers who have parasocial relationships with their fans, which results in the fandom being delusional as if they have romantic ties with the streamer. Because the streamer does not draw a boundary between them and the fan, the fan crosses those boundaries by holding this streamer on a higher pedestal. This involves being protective around the vtuber, making assumptions about every decision the vtuber makes, and lastly attacking everyone around them who criticizes their idol. If the vtuber ever is in the wrong, the fandom would protect the streamer. </p>

        <br>

        <h3 class = "article"> Vtuber fandom / fandoms in general of celebrities and idols </h3> 
        <p class = "paragraph">  Fandoms in general can be toxic; however, it can be a great place if you surround yourself with a fun place that does not condone toxicity, obsession, and victimization of celebrity. The moment fandoms move in groups to attack others who have different opinions, is the moment where fans become deluded to a point in which they think they’re parents/spokesperson’ for the celebrity. In my opinion, the celebrity/streamer has the obligation to actively place those rules there when fandom becomes obviously destructive towards other innocent parties.</p>
