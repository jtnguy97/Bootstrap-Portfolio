        <h3 class = "article"> What are PBTs? </h3>
        <p class = "paragraph"> PBTs are puberty blocking treatments that suppresses the body from releasing sex hormones. In this case, PBT suppresses puberty from undergoing the human body. </p>

        <h3 class = "article"> Do PBTs need to be approved by the legal guardian for minors?</h3>
        <p class = "paragraph"> Puberty blocking treatments should not have to be approved by the parent, because the consequences of taking PBT are more beneficial than not taking it; in addition, it allows transgender individuals a right of property to their own body. However, minors should be educated first on the effects of what will happen when choosing to take PBTs. They must know what they're getting into first before rushing to make a decision without being educated on what will happen to their body. </p>

        <h3 class = "article"> What if the individual regrets PBTs and wants to reverse this procedure? </h3>
        <p class = "pargraph"> There are cases where individuals regret PBTs and we put them into categories. Persisters are group of individuals who continue with cross-sex hormones. Being on cross-sex hormones means therapy that allows an individual to transition to their desired gender all while maintaining their identity. Whereas desisters have a chance to think about their decision and revert back to their natal gender.</p>
        
        <br>

        <h3 class = "article">How can transgender individuals be affected drastically by not taking PBTs? </h3>
        <p class = "paragraph"> There are many physical and psychological outcomes that may happen if PBT is avoided: homelessness, physical abuse, and suicide. Homelessness leads to individuals buying fake PBTs that may be mixed with other unknown substances, which could be lethal to their health. Physical abuse and suicide, often rooting from parents being unsupportive of transgender identity, are the main negative outcomes. It is important to understand that psychological harm should be treated on a similar level as physical harm.</p>

        <h3 class = "article">How can we bring more awareness towards PBTs and the trans community?</h3>
        <p class = "paragraph"> I believe that the state should increase education on LGBTQ+ youth to the public, because a lot of people are unaware about the problems of getting fake PBTs or other dangerous methods to undergo transition. There should also be more discussion about how the trans community is being affected by homelessness, suicide, abuse, and murder. When people are getting killed for their race, sexuality, and gender, the state should make laws to protect those who are targeted and schools should increase education on matters that could be prevented.
