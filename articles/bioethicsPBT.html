PBT is a reversible treatment that allows youth to explore their identity and come to a decision without physical risk. He makes a clear distinction between persisters and desisters: persisters continue on to cross-sex hormones and maintain their identity, whereas desisters have a chance to think about their decision and revert back to their natal gender. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Second, Priest raises awareness on how transgender individuals can be affected drastically by not taking PBT. He mentions many physical and psychological outcomes that may happen if PBT is avoided: homelessness, physical abuse, and suicide. Homelessness leads to individuals buying fake PBTs that may be mixed with other unknown substances, which could be lethal to their health. Physical abuse and suicide, often rooting from parents being unsupportive of transgender identity, are the main negative outcomes. Priest also mentions the importance of how psychological harm should be treated on a similar level as physical harm. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In conclusion, I agree with Priest in that PBTs do not need parent approval because we have our own right to our bodies. Following the consequentialist theory, there are more positives to taking PBT than abstaining from them. Some of other positives are that transgender youth can avoid physical and psychological risks that lead to abuse and suicide. Lastly, I believe that the state should increase education on LGBTQ+ youth to the public, because a lot of people are unaware about the problems that result from this unawareness. For example, more awareness should be raised towards the rise of murders against the transgender community. A majority of those deaths were black, transgender individuals. When people are getting killed for their race, sexuality, and gender, the state should make laws to protect those who are targeted and schools should increase education on matters that could be prevented. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6"></span></p></body></html>
